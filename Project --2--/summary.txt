Summary of chellenges:

I wanted to make some animations appear when the items come into view instead of animating just on refresh,
for that i used an observer to check when the item comes into view and then add the animation.

When I was working on the contact form, the major issue I ran into was the form not validating properly.
I had written some JS to check the inputs, and I was displaying error messages if the user left fields empty or entered invalid data.
But even when the form clearly had issues, it would still go ahead and submit, completely ignoring my validation.
After digging around a bit, I realized that the way I was showing the error messages—by inserting them using `"beforestart"`—wasn’t the right choice.
Changing that to `"afterend"` finally allowed the messages to display correctly, and the form submission was successfully blocked when needed.

Once the validation was working, I faced another problem which was the form submiting and redirecting as expected, but I wasn’t receiving any emails.
At first, I was using a FormSubmit alias link (`formsubmit.co/el/hejula`) that I was given for my email but maybe it wasn't configured fully or such.
That turned out to be the reason the emails weren’t being sent at all.
Switching the action to my actual email (`https://formsubmit.co/nourj2005@gmail.com`) solved that problem. After that, everything worked like it was supposed to.

Overall, the contact form ended up taking more time than I thought, but it was helpful as I learned to use an external form service, FormSubmit.
